# Implementation-of-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Sales-Prediction

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the multivariate linear regression model for sales prediction.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Import the required libraries.
Read the csv file using pandas.
Declare X and Y variable with respect to the dataset.
Predict the values.
Using Mean Square Error find the required line that fits the data.
Print the Mean Square Error and R square error.
End the program.

## Program:
```
